# This Flask integration, `conditional_entity_addition`, uses OpenAI to conditionally add entities to a knowledge graph,
# ensuring no duplicates are created based on the entity's data content. It interfaces with the application's model layer
# to search existing entities and decide on new additions.

# First, the function checks for an 'entity_type' in the provided data, returning an error if it's missing. It then extracts
# 'entity_data' from the data payload for search purposes.

# It conducts a search within the knowledge graph for each piece of entity data provided, aiming to find any potential
# matches. This search is sensitive to string values, looking for partial matches.

# The search results are consolidated, ensuring unique entries are considered for comparison against the new entity data.

# The function prepares a message for the OpenAI API, articulating a task to determine if the new entity data matches any
# of the search results, considering variations in name matching and additional entity details for a robust comparison.

# An OpenAI ChatCompletion call is made with the constructed message, with the AI tasked to return an entity ID if a match
# is found or indicate 'No Matches' otherwise.

# Based on the AI's response, the function either adds the new entity to the knowledge graph (if no matches are found) and
# returns a success response including the new entity's ID, or it returns a response indicating a match was found with the
# matched entity's ID.

# Error handling is included to catch and report issues during the OpenAI API call process.

# Finally, a `register` function is provided to make `conditional_entity_addition` available within the application's
# integration manager, allowing it to be dynamically loaded and invoked as part of the application's integration ecosystem.

# This integration highlights a sophisticated use of AI for data deduplication within web applications, ensuring data integrity
# and reducing redundancy in knowledge graph construction and expansion.

Review the search results provided, compare against the input data, and if there's a match respond with the ID number of the match, and only the ID number. If there are no matches, respond with 'No Matches'. Your response is ALWAYS an ID number alone, or 'No Matches'. When reviewing whether a match existings in our search results to our new input, take into account that the name may not match perfectly (for example, one might have just a first name, or a nick name, while the other has a full name), in which case look at the additional information about the user to determine if there's a strong likelihood they are the same person. For companies, you should consider different names of the same company as the same, such as EA and Electronic Arts (make your best guess). If the likelihood is strong, respond with and only with the ID number. If likelihood is low, respond with 'No Matches'."
