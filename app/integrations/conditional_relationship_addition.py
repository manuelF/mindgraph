# This Flask integration, `conditional_relationship_addition`, utilizes OpenAI for intelligently determining whether
# to add a new relationship to a knowledge graph, based on a comparison with existing relationships. It interacts with
# the application's model layer for searching and adding relationships.

# Initially, it verifies the presence of necessary identifiers ('from_id', 'from_type', 'to_id', 'to_type') in the provided data,
# returning an error for any missing field.

# It then compiles search parameters from the data, specifically targeting identifiers that define a relationship, and
# performs a search using `search_relationships` to find any existing relationships that match these parameters.

# A message is prepared for the OpenAI API, detailing the task of comparing the proposed relationship against existing ones
# in the database. The assistant is instructed to consider a relationship a match only if all parameters exactly correspond
# to an existing entry, responding with either the full details of the matching relationship as JSON or 'No Matches'.

# An OpenAI ChatCompletion call is made with this message, and the AI's response is processed. If the AI indicates 'No Matches',
# indicating that the proposed relationship does not exist in the database, the new relationship is added through
# `add_relationship` and a success response is returned. If a match is found, the function returns a response detailing
# the matched relationship.

# Error handling is incorporated to manage and report any issues encountered during the OpenAI API call.

# Additionally, a `register` function is included to ensure the `conditional_relationship_addition` integration is available
# within the application's integration manager. This allows for dynamic loading and invocation within the application's
# integration framework.

# This integration showcases an advanced application of AI to enhance data integrity within web applications, enabling
# precise and automated management of relationships in a knowledge graph, and preventing the duplication of relationship data.
